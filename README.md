# technicalTreasureHunt

The main zip file named (technicalTreasureHunt.zip) consists of a chain of challenges as if the forthcoming one is unlocked by solving the previous challenge and providing the key to open the next zip. The challenges are created with three languages (i.e java,C,python), To get the hint for the key one can refer the keyHint.txt file present inside each zip. I have uploaded the challenge codes seperately also, but its just for read-only purposes, some challenges cannot be solved directly with those files.
